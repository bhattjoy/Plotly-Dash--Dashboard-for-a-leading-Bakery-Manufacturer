# Plotly-Dash--Dashboard-for-a-leading-Bakery-Manufacturer
We were given weekly consumption data and marketing spend data across different regions for all of its product variants. The goal of this project was to : 
1) determine the priority order of tactics. Examples include TV, digital, sponsorships and displays. 
2) determine which campaigns like summer and holiday returned the most consumption.  
3) to identify the highest return on investments for sales tactics and marketing activations.
